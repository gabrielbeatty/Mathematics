        <h2>Why is This Important?</h2>

            <p>Have you ever heard the phrase “A picture is worth a thousand words?”
            Say you have 1000 measurements that you have taken. How could you express those measurements (data) in a clear way that people could understand? 
            Graphs are all around us and they show us complex information in a way that makes the information clear and easy to understand. There are lots of different ways to represent information using graphs. There are also lots of different kinds of graphs. Scientists, doctors, nurses, economists, weather forecasters, city planners and lots of others use graphs to communicate important information.</p>
